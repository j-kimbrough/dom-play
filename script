<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE 
Need more rivets.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="henry">HENRY 
Coming with a bucket of rivets.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="wayne">WAYNE 
Art, heads up … new piston on the belt.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="arthur">ARTHUR 
Ready.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="larry">LARRY
Put another tick mark on the tally.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="joe">JOE
That puts us past last month’s quota.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER
My cousin got his draft notice. He is headed to boot camp next week.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
With America in the war, won’t we all be called into service?</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER
Some men have already volunteered.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
I plan to join the Marines by summer.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="arthur">ARTHUR
Really, Charlie, you’re going to volunteer?</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
Of course! Just as every red-blooded American man should want to do.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="arthur">ARTHUR
I suppose, but I can wait until my draft notice arrives.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="henry">HENRY
I’ll volunteer with you Charlie. But I’m gonna join the Navy.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
I’ve always wanted to be a Marine.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="larry">LARRY
The Marines are always in the thick of things. I’m gonna stick with being a mechanic and fix all the stuff you GI Joes break.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="wayne">WAYNE
I gotta farm to run with my folks and wife, as well as my job here.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="joe">JOE
And me and my wife just had baby number 4. Wouldn’t want to leave her all by herself with all that noise and chaos.
</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
Each man will need to do his duty. Some can get deferrals to take care of necessary business at home.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="courier">COURIER
[Enters and crosses to CHARLIE.] I’m looking for Colonel Frank Westwood.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
He’s up in the office, use those stairs.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="courier">COURIER
Thanks. [Crosses to Supervisor’s office.]</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER
Looks like that may be the news we’ve all been waiting for.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="wayne">WAYNE
Ya, that sure looked official.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
Frank will share with us if it’s news for all.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="courier">COURIER
[Knocks and enters office.] Sir, I have draft notices for your employees.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="frank">COL FRANK
I was expecting those. I’ll deliver the news. [COURIER exits.]
[COL FRANK crosses onto factory floor, work stops.]
Well, men. We knew it was only a matter of time until your draft notices arrived. And here they are. [Distributes envelopes.] I am also being called out of retirement to set up training and will be seeing many of you at the local training center. I think we should just clean up and call it a day. We can all go together to the enlistment office and get this taken care of.</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE
Frank, do we all just sign up with the Army? I know a couple fellas who want to be in the Navy, and I want to be a Marine.
</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="frank">COL FRANK
That can all be taken care of at the enlistment office. Anyone with special skills will be wanted in specific departments. They need men in all branches of the service. You will all be interviewed and then take aptitude tests.
</span></p>

<p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER
Sounds good to me. I am ready to serve and get this war over with quickly.</span></p>
<p>[Conveyor belt is pushed to back wall or out of site to make way for new scene. Light change.]</p>
