        Need more rivets.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="henry">HENRY <br/>
        Coming with a bucket of rivets.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="wayne">WAYNE <br/>
        Art, heads up … new piston on the belt.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="arthur">ARTHUR <br/>
        Ready.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="larry">LARRY<br/>
        Put another tick mark on the tally.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="joe">JOE<br/>
        That puts us past last month’s quota.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER<br/>
        My cousin got his draft notice. He is headed to boot camp next week.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        With America in the war, won’t we all be called into service?</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER<br/>
        Some men have already volunteered.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        I plan to join the Marines by summer.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="arthur">ARTHUR<br/>
        Really, Charlie, you’re going to volunteer?</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        Of course! Just as every red-blooded American man should want to do.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="arthur">ARTHUR<br/>
        I suppose, but I can wait until my draft notice arrives.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="henry">HENRY<br/>
        I’ll volunteer with you Charlie. But I’m gonna join the Navy.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        I’ve always wanted to be a Marine.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="larry">LARRY<br/>
        The Marines are always in the thick of things. I’m gonna stick with being a mechanic and fix all the stuff you GI Joes break.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="wayne">WAYNE<br/>
        I gotta farm to run with my folks and wife, as well as my job here.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="joe">JOE<br/>
        And me and my wife just had baby number 4. Wouldn’t want to leave her all by herself with all that noise and chaos.
        </span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        Each man will need to do his duty. Some can get deferrals to take care of necessary business at home.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="courier">COURIER<br/>
        [Enters and crosses to CHARLIE.] I’m looking for Colonel Frank Westwood.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        He’s up in the office, use those stairs.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="courier">COURIER<br/>
        Thanks. [Crosses to Supervisor’s office.]</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER<br/>
        Looks like that may be the news we’ve all been waiting for.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="wayne">WAYNE<br/>
        Ya, that sure looked official.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        Frank will share with us if it’s news for all.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="courier">COURIER<br/>
        [Knocks and enters office.] Sir, I have draft notices for your employees.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="frank">COL FRANK<br/>
        I was expecting those. I’ll deliver the news. [COURIER exits.]<br/>
        [COL FRANK crosses onto factory floor, work stops.]<br/>
        Well, men. We knew it was only a matter of time until your draft notices arrived. And here they are. <br/>
        [Distributes envelopes.] I am also being called out of retirement to set up training and will be seeing many of you at the local training center. <br/>
        I think we should just clean up and call it a day. We can all go together to the enlistment office and get this taken care of.</span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="charlie">CHARLIE<br/>
        Frank, do we all just sign up with the Army? I know a couple fellas who want to be in the Navy, and I want to be a Marine.
        </span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="frank">COL FRANK<br/>
        That can all be taken care of at the enlistment office. Anyone with special skills will be wanted in specific departments. <br/>
        They need men in all branches of the service. You will all be interviewed and then take aptitude tests.
        </span></p>
        
        <p><span data-actor="walter">WALTER<br/>
        Sounds good to me. I am ready to serve and get this war over with quickly.</span></p>
